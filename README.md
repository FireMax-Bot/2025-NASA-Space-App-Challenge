# 🌸 BloomWatch

**BloomWatch** is a web-based 3D visualization tool built by **Team 5** for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.
It uses **CesiumJS** and **Earth observation data** to explore global flowering phenology — how and when plants bloom across the planet.

---

## 🚀 Overview

BloomWatch displays an interactive **3D globe** showing real-world terrain, 3D structures, and key observation points.
It aims to help visualize changes in blooming patterns and environmental trends affected by climate change.
